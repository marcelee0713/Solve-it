# Solveit

Solviet it just my personal repository where I put the DSA-Related and LeetCode problems I'll solve.

In every folder will contain two files,

- A README file that I'll explain how I solved it.
- A TypeScript file where it contains the code.

I'll be using VS Code with the extension of Quokka, it'll show the output of your code right in your editor.
